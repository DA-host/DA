Q3: Employee Payroll Analysis Using Data Frame
You are assigned to analyze employee payroll data using a data frame in R. The company has 5
employees, and their data includes: Name, Age, Department, Basic Salary, and Bonus. Your goal is to
create a data frame and perform operations to assist the HR department in salary analysis.
Tasks:
1. Create a data frame named employees with the following columns:
i. Name (character), Age (numeric), Department (character), Basic Salary (numeric), Bonus
(numeric)
2. Add a new column to calculate the Total Salary for each employee (Basic + Bonus).
3. Identify:
i. The highest paid employee
ii. The average salary by department using the aggregate() function
4. Filter and display employees earning a total salary above â‚¹60,000.
PROGRAM:
employees <- data.frame(
 Name = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"),
 Age = c(30, 25, 29, 35, 32),
 Department = c("HR", "Finance", "IT", "HR", "IT"),
 Basic = c(40000, 50000, 45000, 47000, 66000),
 Bonus = c(5000, 6000, 5500, 5000, 6500)
)
# Total Salary
employees$Total <- employees$Basic + employees$Bonus
# Highest Paid
employees[which.max(employees$Total), ]
# Avg salary by dept
aggregate(Total ~ Department, data = employees, FUN = mean)
# Salary > 60000
subset(employees, Total > 60000)
